simple reference for SQL queries used to create tables, so I don't have to write them again.

WOULD NOT HAVE THIS FILE ON A PRODUCTION SITE!!!!!!

CREATE TABLE `codeigniter2`.`user` (
	`id` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	`username` VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
	`password` VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
	`first_name` VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
	`last_name` VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
	UNIQUE (
		`username`
	)
)
