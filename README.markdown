# CI-JS

A simple webapp built on CodeIgniter 2 with php-activerecord as the ORM for the purpose of testing various javascript frameworks such as backbone.js and ember.js.  This is a simple personal project and not likely something anyone else would be interested in.

- CodeIgniter 2.0
- PHP-ActiveRecord ORM  (may change)

- few basic models 

- desire to swap out backbone.js and possibly other frameworks to see how they work with a server side backend rather than the HTML5 local-storage that most tutorials use.
